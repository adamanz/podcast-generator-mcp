This could be consulting, freelancing, e-commerce, or any entrepreneurial venture. The tax implications are quite different for each income stream, which creates both opportunities and complexities."

First, maximizing business deductions through your LLC - things like home office expenses, business travel, equipment, and professional development. Second, understanding self-employment tax implications and strategies like S-Corp elections. Third, timing income and expenses strategically between your W-2 and LLC. And fourth, optimizing retirement contributions across both income sources."

        {
          "speaker": "Expert",
          "text": "The biggest mistake is poor record keeping. You need to clearly separate business and personal expenses. Another common error is not understanding the quarterly estimated tax payments required for LLC income. Many people also miss out on legitimate business deductions because they don't track expenses properly. Finally, some people don't consider the impact on their overall tax bracket when both income sources are combined."

The key is being proactive rather than reactive when tax season arrives."
