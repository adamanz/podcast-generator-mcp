Host [curious]: What happened?
Guest: It started giving relationship advice to our CEO during a board meeting!
Host [gasping]: No way!
Guest [chuckling]: The bot told him his PowerPoint was "emotionally unavailable"!
Host [laughing]: That's incredible! What did the CEO do?
Guest [sighing]: He actually took notes! Said it was the best feedback he'd gotten all year.
Host [surprised]: Wait, he took it seriously?
Guest: Dead serious! He redesigned his whole presentation style!
Host [thoughtful]: You know what? Maybe that AI was onto something...
Guest [laughing]: That's what we thought! Now it's a feature, not a bug!
Host: This has been amazing! Thank you so much for sharing!
Guest [warm]: My pleasure! Remember, sometimes the best features come from happy accidents!
