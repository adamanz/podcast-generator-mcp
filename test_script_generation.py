Many professionals today have a traditional W-2 job - maybe they're an engineer, teacher, or marketing manager - but they also run a side business through an LLC.

First, maximizing business deductions through your LLC - things like home office expenses, business travel, equipment, and professional development. Second, understanding self-employment tax implications and strategies like S-Corp elections. Third, timing income and expenses strategically between your W-2 and LLC.

Another common error is not understanding the quarterly estimated tax payments required for LLC income. Many people also miss out on legitimate business deductions because they don't track expenses properly. Finally, some people don't consider the impact on their overall tax bracket when both income sources are combined."
